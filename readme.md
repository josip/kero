# Kero ðŸ“Š

Kero is a privacy-friendly, embeddable, analytics dashboard for your Go websites. With its drop-in integrations, it's the easiest way to get an overview of the key web metrics.

* **Privacy-friendly**: Kero tracks server-side requests with limited access to identifiable user data, compared to client-side solutions.
* **Embedded**: Import Kero middleware and you're ready to go, there are no additional databases or servers to provision and maintain.
* **Easy to understand**: Kero comes with a glanceable dashboard that contains all the data you care about on a single page.

## Getting started

Kero integrates with Gin and Fiber out of the box:

<summary><b>Gin example</b></summary>

```golang
package mywebsite

import (
    "os"

    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"

    "github.com/josip/kero"
    keromw "github.com/josip/kero/keroginmw"
)

func Main() {
    r := gin.New()
    // 1) Initialize Kero
    k, _ := kero.New(
        kero.WithDBPath("./kero-stats"),
        kero.WithDashboardPath("/_kero"),
        // measures response time
        kero.WithRequestMeasurements(true),
        // doesn't log requests to .css/.js/.png/etc.
        kero.WithWebAssetsIgnored(true),
        // doesn't log requests from bots and HTTP libraries
        kero.WithBotsIgnored(true),
    )
    defer k.Close()

    // 2) Expose dashboard UI, protected with Basic Auth
    keromw.MountDashboard(r, k, gin.Accounts{
        os.Getenv("KERO_ADMIN_USERNAME"): os.Getenv("KERO_ADMIN_PW"),
    })

    // 3) Track all incoming requests
    r.Use(keromw.RequestTracker(k))

    r.GET("/hello", func(ctx *gin.Context) {
        c.String(200, "Hello")
    })

    r.Run()

    // 4) Open http://localhost:8080/_kero
}
```

<summary><b>Fiber example</b></summary>

```golang
package mywebsite

import (
    "os"

    "github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2"
    "github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2/middleware/basicauth"

    "github.com/josip/kero"
    keromw "github.com/josip/kero/kerofibermw"
)

func Main() {
    app := fiber.New()
    // 1) Initialize Kero
    k, _ := kero.New(
        kero.WithDBPath("./kero-stats"),
        kero.WithDashboardPath("/_kero"),
        // measures response time
        kero.WithRequestMeasurements(true),
        // doesn't log requests to .css/.js/.png/etc.
        kero.WithWebAssetsIgnored(true),
        // doesn't log requests from bots and HTTP libraries
        kero.WithBotsIgnored(true),
    )
    defer k.Close()

    // 2) Expose dashboard UI, protected with Basic Auth
    keromw.MountDashboard(app, k, basicauth.Config{
        Users: {
            os.Getenv("KERO_ADMIN_USERNAME"): os.Getenv("KERO_ADMIN_PW"),
        },
    })

    // 3) Track all incoming requests
    app.Use(keromw.RequestTracker(k))

    app.Get("/hello", func(ctx *fiber.Ctx) error {
        return ctx.SendString("Hello")
    })

    app.Listen(":8080")

    // 4) Open http://localhost:8080/_kero
}
```

## Displayed data

* Number of visitors in current and previous period (for comparison)
* Number of views (requests) in current and previous period
* Top pages
* Top referrals (based on `Referrer` HTTP header)
* Top locations (if enabled, based on IP and GeoIP address)
* Top form factors (based on `User-Agent` HTTP header)
* Top browsers (based on `User-Agent` HTTP header)
* Top operating systems (based on `User-Agent` HTTP header)
* Top routes (as defined in your HTTP framework of choice)
* Slowest routes (if enabled, average response time in milliseconds)
* Top bots and libraries (based on `User-Agent` HTTP header)

## Tracked user data

Availability and accuracy of the data collected varies and should be considered approximative as data .

* Browser name and its version
* OS name and its version
* Device name ()
* Device form factor (phone, tablet, desktop, bot)
* Referrer (based on HTTP header) and [UTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTM_parameters) query parameters
* Country, region and city based on user's IP address (disabled by default)
* Visitor ID (see below)

## How are visitors counted?

Each visitor is assigned a hashed ID that encodes their IP address and values of `Accept`, `Accept-Encoding`, `Accept-Language` and `User-Agent` HTTP headers.

As these values are not guaranteed to be unique even between consecutive visits of a same user on a same device, they have been selected for giving an approximate number of visitors while respecting their privacy as much as possible.

DNT header value is ignored.
